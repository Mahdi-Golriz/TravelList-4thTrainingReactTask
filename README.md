## About
- I have started to learn the React through a course from the Udemy instructed by Jonas Schmedtmann. During this course I should develop many training task, projects and applications. This is the 4th task of this course :).
- In this section I learned about:
  * Building a simple component
  * Handling events in React (onClick)
  * Creating state variable with useState
  * How to update state with setter function not manually
  * Using state to implement css class conditionally
  * looping over lists to create a new component
 
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* React & Create React App

## Setup
This repository consists of two branches:
* master - the source code of the React app
* gh-pages - the React app built from that source code
